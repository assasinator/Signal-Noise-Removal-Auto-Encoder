# Signal Noise Removal Auto-Encoder
Overview
The Signal Noise Removal Auto-Encoder project is an implementation of an autoencoder neural network for removing noise from signals. This project uses Keras and TensorFlow to build an autoencoder that is trained on noisy signal data to denoise them effectively. It aims to improve signal quality in various applications such as speech processing, image denoising, or sensor data enhancement.

Features:
1. Denoising capability for signals (e.g., audio, images, etc.).
2. Built using Keras and TensorFlow for easy model training and experimentation.
3. Fully configurable model architecture.
4. Simple and effective implementation for noise removal.
